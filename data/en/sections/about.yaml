# your designation
designation: An open data sharing and metadata synthesis platform for clinical data

# a summary about you
summary: 'We are working with clinicians, neuroimagers, and software developers to develop an open source platform for the storage, sharing, synthesis and meta-analysis of human clinical data to the service of the clinical and cognitive neuroscience community so that the future of neuropsychology can be transdiagnostic, open, and FAIR.


Following the steps of what enable a similar transition in functional neuroimaging, we are breaking down our over-ambitious goal in two stages: (1) create a meta-analytical platform covering lesion-related data hence allowing causal inferences; (2) a data-sharing platform taylored to clinical needs.'
