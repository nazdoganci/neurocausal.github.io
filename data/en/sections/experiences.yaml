- company:
    name: We are planning on attending the OHBM hackathon to work on the development of the platform. Our short-term goals can be broken into three steps. First, define which vocabulary we need to enable the mapping lesion-to-symptom;Â  an ontological problem we are trying to solve merging our clinical expertise with community tools such as the cognitive atlas. Second, get the papers - hitting paywalls has never hurt so much! - and understand the feasibility of it all. Third, dive into the neuroquery code base - as we believe that it is the tool out there closer to what we have in mind (e.g., could we have a version of this that returns only clinically relevant information?)
